The [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/steve1215rogg/student-lifestyle-dataset) consists of responses from 2,000 students collected through a standardized questionnaire. It includes data on self-reported academic performance (GPA), perceived stress level (Low, Moderate, or High), and various lifestyle habits.

In this report, we will focus on GPA, stress level, and daily physical activity duration, measured in hours.
