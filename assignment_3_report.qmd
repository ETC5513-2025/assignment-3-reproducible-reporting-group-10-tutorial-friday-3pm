## Executive summary

This report investigates the relationship between physical activity, academic performance (GPA), and stress levels among 2,000 students. Physical activity duration was categorized into four groups to examine patterns and trade-offs. The analysis finds that students engaging in higher levels of daily physical activity tend to report lower stress but also slightly lower GPA. These findings support promoting balanced physical activity to enhance well-being without compromising academic success.
