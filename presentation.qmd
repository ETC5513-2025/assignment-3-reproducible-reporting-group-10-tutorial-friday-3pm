## Problem Introduction {.slide-in}

::: {.fragment}
- 🎓 Student well-being is a growing concern
:::

::: {.fragment}
- 🏃 Physical activity is known to reduce stress, but its impact on academic performance (GPA) is unclear.
:::

::: {.fragment}
- ❓ **Research question**:  
  How does daily physical activity impact:
  
  - 📚 GPA?
  
  - 😟 Stress levels?
:::

---

## Dataset Description {.slide-in}

::: {.fragment}
- 📝 Source: A Google Form survey completed by **2,000 students**
:::

::: {.fragment}
- 📊 Data set includes students' self-reported GPA, stress levels and various lifestyle habits 
:::

::: {.fragment}
- 🔍 Key variables used in the study:
  - 🎓 **GPA**: 4.0 scale
  - 😰 **Stress level**: Low, Moderate, High
  - 🏃️ **Physical activity**: Hours per day 
:::

## Methods {.slide-in}

::: {.fragment}
::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="65%"}
```{r}
#| label: fig-pa_group
#| fig-cap: Distribution of physical activity hours per day
#| fig-pos: "H"
#| out-width: "100%"

ggplot(data, aes(x = Physical_Activity_Hours_Per_Day)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "#69b3a2", color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Physical Activity Hours Per Day",
       y = "Number of Students") +
  theme_minimal()  +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10)),
        axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = 10)))
```
:::

::: {.column width="35%"}
- 📌 Most students exercised between 2–6 hours/day.

- 📈 Right-skewed distribution with few extremes.

### Group classification {.slide-in}

::: {.fragment}
- 🧮 Figure 1 forms the foundation for the group classification.
:::

::: {.fragment}
- ⏱️ Physical activity duration is grouped into:
  - Under 2 hours 
  - 2–3 hours 
  - 4–5 hours 
  - More than 6 hours
:::

---

### Summary of key statistics {.slide-in}

::: {.fragment}
| Physical activity group | Average GPA | Average stress |
|-------------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Under 2 hours           | 3.26        | 2.64           |
| 2–3 hours               | 3.17        | 2.45           |
| 4–5 hours               | 3.09        | 2.25           |
| More than 6 hours       | 2.98        | 2.19           |
:::

<div style="margin-top: 0.75em;"></div>
```{r}
# Grouping physical activity duration
data2 <- data %>%
  mutate(pa_group = case_when(
    Physical_Activity_Hours_Per_Day < 2 ~ "Under 2 hours",
    Physical_Activity_Hours_Per_Day >= 2 & Physical_Activity_Hours_Per_Day < 4

🔢 Stress level encoded: Low = 1, Moderate = 2, High = 3 
:::
<div style="margin-top: 0.5em;"></div>
::: {.fragment}
📉 Trend: A gradual decrease in both GPA and perceived stress level with increasing physical activity.

### Interpretation {.slide-in}

::: {.fragment}
- 📉 An **inverse trend** was observed:
    - More physical activity associated with **less stress**.
    - But also with **slightly lower GPA**.
:::

::: {.fragment}
- ⚖️ This suggests a **trade-off** between mental well-being and academic outcomes.
:::

---

### Limitations

::: {.fragment}
- 🧾 Self-reported data may be subject to **bias**.
:::

::: {.fragment}
- 🚫 Unable to infer **causality** from correlation.
:::

::: {.fragment}
- 🧩 **Potential confounders** (e.g., sleep, workload) are not accounted for.
:::

---

## Conclusion & Recommendations {.slide-in}

::: {.fragment}
- Promoting **moderate activity** (2–5 hours/day) may help reduce stress without significantly harming academic performance.
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Institutions should support students through:
  - Wellness programs promoting regular physical activity  
  - **Time management workshops** for balancing exercise and study
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Future research should account for **sleep**, **nutrition**, and **academic workload** to gain deeper insights.
